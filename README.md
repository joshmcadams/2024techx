# Creating an LLM
## Tech Exchange 2024

Welcome to the Tech Exchange 2024 "Creating an LLM" session.

This repository will be updated throughout the session with the current working version of the code. If you get behind or just want to compare your code against what we are doing in class, this is the place. [gir.fyi/techx/llm](https://gir.fyi/techx/llm) is the short link that will bring to this repo.
